"""This is the main file for your game. You'll need to make sure this file runs properly in order to play your game.

At minimum, you'll need to implement the following:
- A class to represent the game state and game logic.
- A run method to start the game loop.
- Any other classes, functions, etc, that you need to implement the game.

For example, if you were writing Snake, you would rename this file to snake.py, and create a class called Snake
(For this example you may want to write a class for the player, the food, etc, depending on your implementation).

You can use the Pong class as a starting point for your game.

# TODO: Rename this file to the name of your game, ie: snake.py
# TODO: Create a class with the same name as the file, ie: class Snake:
# TODO: Create a run method to start the game loop, ie: def run(self):
# TODO: Implement the game logic and state in the class.
# TODO: Create any other classes, functions, etc, that you need for your game.
# TODO: REPLACE THIS DOC STRING WITH YOUR OWN, DESCRIBING YOUR GAME AND HOW TO PLAY.
